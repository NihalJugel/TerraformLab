📌 Overview

This Terraform project provisions an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance on AWS and performs end-to-end automation by:

Creating infrastructure (EC2, Security Group, Key Pair)

Configuring the instance as a web server

Executing commands on the remote EC2 instance

Executing commands locally on the Terraform machine

Exposing both public and private IPs as outputs

This configuration demonstrates advanced Terraform provisioner usage.
